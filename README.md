## Receipt_Scanner_DIP

Receipt_Scanner_DIP is an advanced image processing project developed using OpenCV and Python. This project aims to automate the handling and data extraction of receipts through the implementation of Deep Learning and Image Processing techniques.

## Features
Capture receipt images from webcams or existing files
Apply image processing techniques such as grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, thresholding, edge detection, dilation, and erosion
Detect and isolate the largest contour representing the receipt's main area
Perform perspective transformation to obtain a flat, top-down view of the receipt
Utilize adaptive thresholding to extract text and information from the receipt image
Save processed receipt images for further analysis or documentation

## Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/ahmaddioxide/Receipt_Scanner_DIP.git
Run the main script:
python receipt_scanner.py

## Follow the on-screen instructions to capture or provide the receipt image.
The processed image will be displayed, and you can save it by pressing the 's' key.
